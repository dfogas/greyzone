While TDD is very useful as solid design principle and way to test backward compatibility, it is by no means complete testing framework.
Mathematically speaking it is maybe not even 'a necessary condition', though it is very handy tool.
What we look for here is functional testing 'does it do what it is supposed to do'
Taking a hammer and see if I can beat a nail of certain parameters to material of certain parameters in how many strikes
instead of measuring the shape of hammer and material of which its head is made. Which is better?
Sufficient condition is here - we know that hammer of certain parameters can do its job, so we require those parameters vs.
sufficient condition trial test the hammer if it can do the same without testing if it complies with parameters of hammer that we know will succeed.
Some call it system testing I would probably call it rather functional testing.
Anyway no matter how we call it functional testing of software testing is, it produces happy users (and posibly happy software designers, UX and DX).
