Setting up mongoose model

make new Schema with properties and their values set to mongoose possible types
- String
- Number
- Boolean
- Date
- Mixed
- Array
- Buffer
- ObjectId
use it to create model

HINT: Schema.Types.Mixed for objects, [Schema.Types.Mixed] for arrays

export that model
now you can import it and work with it (most likely in the controller handling Rest api calls)
