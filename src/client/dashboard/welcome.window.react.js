        <p>
          This game is still before production.
          You can play it, but weird shit might happen, and also you might lose your game saves.
          Also game assets(pictures, texts and other) are too lacking yet.
          So play and enjoy the experience, but bear that in mind.
        </p>

        <p>
          <h2>Game Ends</h2>
          <ul>Bad Ends:
            <li>Given Up</li>
            <li>Betrayed</li>
            <li>Rich, But Not For Long</li>
          </ul>
          <ul>Good Ends:
            <li>Rich and Covered</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          Recommended is reading Gameplay/Introduction section of About/Help before starting of your game.
