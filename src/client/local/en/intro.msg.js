      That's about it - you start, you play, you finish, earlier or later

    <h2>Game Features</h2>
    <p>
      GhostStruggle is a multiplayer web game designed with intention
      to provide interesting playing mechanism with emphasis on functionality, first,
      and then on beauty, second.
      As it seems that perfection is achieved only when there's nothing left to
      take away rather than still adding new features, it strives to keep only
      necessary features for core game mechanisms and keep all other bullshit away.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is designed as commercial product, but emphasis being on playability
      and employing your brain, not on serving you fancy content and draining your
      credit card for overpriced collection pieces.

  gameplay: `
    <p>
      You direct organization in strategical AND tactical sense
      by managing its resources and staying hidden from official probing,
      while upholding respectable reputation for potential clients of yours.
      To fullfill this objective you hire agents, equip them with tools for their job,
      assign them to missions and with rewards for success enhance organization
      to higher levels, with agents getting better along the way as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      With new missions new possibilities open but the inherent nature of
      your enterprise is filled with dangers as well, so be aware
      that your game might come quickly to an end, if you mismanage or
      simply risk too much at once and have bad luck.
    </p>
    <p>
      Custom campaigns are here to challenge you to reach for achievements and
      provide a bit of story and destiny choosing.
      Higher level also opens up multiplayer, where you compete with other players
      on global level, giving you possibility to directly hit them with your crew,
      but you may also stick single player only.

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Does a man choose his profession, or does profession choose a man?
      I chose not to be a - what? - Villain?
      Villain might be too of a strong word, let's say I am not the one
      to be bound by conventions about what is good and evil,
      and that I do things my way.
    </p>
    <p>
      People like to have order. Give them order and you have their vote in the elections.
      Then have the police and special forces to do this task given by public.
      Does that mean that order is automatically good? Of course it does, for most.
    </p>
    <p>
      My organization is not so narrow-minded. Do you need money real fast?
      Or to get rid of that pesky competitor,
      bringing in that new piece to your prized collection?
      To protect or to silence key witness?
      We do that.
      Turn to us, to professionals. We get things done.
    </p>
    <p>
      As always, this lifestyle does have its price. I can't turn up,
      at the Social Security Office
      and start asking for aliments. What have you been doing so far?
      Oh, I was a head of secret
      organization doing this here and that over there - Al Pacino style,
      fully visualizing it right now ...

    <h3>What is it and how do I play it?</h3>
    <p>
      By signup to GhostStruggle game you become a head of illegal organization,
      which is not necessarily a bad thing, except it is.
      The organization provides all kinds of - services,
      that are usually frowned upon by state organizations, mainly because
      they consider them their monopoly.
    </p>
    <p>
      After signup, you log in and the game pretty much guides you through its
      interface then, though I strongly recommend reading help page as well.
