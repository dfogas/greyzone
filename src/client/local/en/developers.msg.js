    <h2>Ghost Struggle production</h2>
    <p>
      As the development of GS is on ongoing basis, I declare 27th September of 2016 the day that it went to production.
      You can play it and expect good performance, free of gamecrashing bugs.
      As such it maybe now bought in the options by selecting paying status.
    </p>
    <p>
      The game now has 5 bad ends and 1 good end. Ingame walkthrough is being made. Ultimately the ends are giving a
      meaning to the game but the important thing is the experience you have while playing it.
    </p>
    <h3>Disclaimer</h3>
    <p>
      All graphic assets are original, but may be based on actually existing people or movie/game characters.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may buy full access to the game in the options menu, when logged in (not including two planned campaigns).
