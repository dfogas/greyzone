        A group of wealthy and classy people passes you by. A memory of how you spent
        sucking up to your rich peers passes your mind.
        Since you have much wider range of capabilities now, you wonder,
        how much of this 'dolce vita' life can you claim for yourself
        without giving yourself away to legal enforcement.
        It didn't take you long to realize, that this is something you always
        wanted...

      Perhaps some more cash spent in that direction would mean fulfillment again.

      Your drive is getting better and you recieve few invitations to social functions

      intrigued - you decide to investigate it further.<br />
      As it would seem some part of rich people, consider themselves something more,
      than the rest given their heritage and so. It might to for a good topping to borrow
      yourself a respectable title, perhaps pay someone to discover that you are of
      noble origin.

      As you strech your legs, sitting in cozy bieder-meier
      chair, smelling cognac in the special glass, you realize that you have everything
      you ever dreamed of. Most of the people that were subject of your envy now envies you
      and you even did not have to work that hard to achieve that.<br />
      Life is excellent, but what if you could make it spectacular? You contemplate posibilities
      as your plan is coming to its final form.

      You've made it! You got more cash than you can ever spend and high society status.

      Perhaps it is time to consider way out. If only you can successfully cover your tracks...
