  anAnt: [`I noticed strange behavior of an ant once, he climbed to the top of the halm of grass and fell down,
    relentlessly over and over, I was wondering why was he doing it?`, `It turned out that he has nothing to gain
    from such behavior, it's a fluke, Lancet Fluke to be precise`, `It is a parasitic worm that has to get to

  anOtter: [`I once watched river life and saw an otter pulling out a fish out of water. She has cut out the roe
    with her claw and then her youngs have come and ate it. It was a day nothing out of ordinary and

    the secretariat of organizer, so that I don't have to keep carrying and watching it.
