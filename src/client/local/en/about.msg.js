  message: `<p>"Ghost Struggle" is a non-trivial, non-clicker game for aspiring masterminds, that simply works, possibly
    creates an enjoyable experience as well.</p>
    <p>Theme is espionage, world of secret investigative organizations, and you are put in charge of building up one - your own,
    with your own objectives.</p>
    <p>You leading a secret organization equals you having missions to complete.
    You may participate on missions, as your avatar is represented by one of the agents.</br>
    This not always advisable though - as some missions besides earning considerable rewards,
    may throw you in the prison or even get killed.</p>
    <p>Based on tried and tested dice and cards mechanism, game provides the challenge you've been looking for,
    in an easy and enjoyable way, also offering wide range of tactical approaches.</p>
    It is not always fair and might push some unexpected events your way,
    though always giving some time to react and it is moderately difficult to finish -
    successfully finish,<br />bad ends are abundant and you might quite easily end up facing one.
    Not to worry, replaying is advisable option as the game was designed to be played repeatedly and
    should through its mechanisms introduce new story each time that it is played.</p>
    <p>At its current state there is only one successfull finish. There are going to be purchaseable expansions to game, that
    expand gameplay significantly as well as add interaction with other players, so you may start messing with each other, if you like so.</p>
    <p>Feel free to join and try game in its current development state, and
    possibly leave a feedback on provided email address support@ghoststruggle.com or you might as well join forum(tbd) and if you
    really enjoyed playing it become sponsor with stake in its future by providing financial support via Patreon(tbd), with direct link
    to its creator.</p>`,
