      "Ghost Struggle" is a game which theme is espionage, world of secret
      investigative organizations, and you are put in charge of building up one
      - your own, with your own objectives.
    </p>
    <p>
      Secret organization has missions to do and agents to complete them and
      you are part of this picture, as your avatar is represented by one of the agents.
    </p>
    <p>
      Based on tried and tested dice and cards mechanism, game provides the challenge
      in an easy and enjoyable way, also offering wide range of tactical approaches.
      Since doing espionage is tricky and dangerous, game captures that fact and might
      come to you as difficult, but I ensure you it is very playable. <br />
      A word of warning, bad ends might happen, so repeated playing is advisable option,
      as the game was designed to introduce new story each time that it is played.
    </p>
    <p>
      Multiplayer work is accounted for in design, though not implemented yet.
      When it is done players are going to have competitive interactions among them.
      Feel free to sign up and try game in its current development state, and
      possibly leave a feedback on provided email address support@ghoststruggle.com
