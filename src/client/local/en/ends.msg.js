    towards its end in luxurious retirement house with all the given care
    of nice nurses, you recieve a visit from young aspiring writer,
    who recieved a tip on you from one of your previous contacts. She
    asks you for your help. Laughing, you agree to share few details
    for her book on private clandestine organizations, that are ever so
    omnipresent...

  richanddiscovered: `After a year or so that you quit the business with
    significant reserves for your comfortable life you recieved
    a fair warning from one of your previous contacts. Quickly leaving the life
    you've been leading was essential so you used one of your fallback plans
    to find new life, under new identity. Still your trace is fresh so the
    tracking dogs are going to find you. Staying on watch is demanding
    and you can't hold for long this way. But for now you still fighting it,
    perhaps new organization will enable you to finally hide from this probing.

    Congratulations. You successfully completed a prized collection of yours.
    Hidden well from the preying sight of another collectors, you can enjoy
    the fruits of your labor as long as you like, before your financial
    situation will force you to work your contacts in the underworld again
    for some more cash or new collection piece, perhaps.

    Horror has set upon you as you realize, that you've been discovered!
    Grabbing your most cherished piece and escaping through hidden tunnel

    This situation has to be remedied immediately, you pulled up your
    secure phone and started making calls again.

  revengeandhidden: `
    The thoughts of punishment of those who harmed you and those near to you
    have been filling your conscious existence for as long as you can remember
    but that's done now, with subjects of your revenge 6 foot deep or even
    deeper.
    You escaped consequences of your actions undetected
    but what now, feeling emotinally empty, what will you do now -
    will you find it within yourself to pursue new goals in your life?

    You were caught exercising your revenge personally and now awaiting
    the trial. You'll end up with bullet or injection up your vein or perhaps with
    life sentence if you're in more civilized region of the world.
    The punishment that you delivered to those that harmed you and those near to you
    may give you sense of fulfilment of your purpose though.

    In a rush you decide to disappear and leave everything behind.
    Not the wisest of moves as your prying opponents will have only little
